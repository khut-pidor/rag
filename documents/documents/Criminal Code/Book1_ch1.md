## Book 1: General Provisions

### Title 1: The Criminal Law

#### Chapter 1: General Principles

### Article 1: Scope of Application of the Criminal Law

The criminal law defines offences, determines those who may be found guilty of committing them, sets penalties, and determines how they shall be enforced.

Where necessary, statutory instruments issued by the executive branch may define petty offences that are punishable only by a fine.

### Article 2: Definition and Classification of Offences

The law provides that offences are certain acts committed by natural persons or legal entities which cause social disturbance. Offences are classified pursuant to their seriousness as felonies, misdemeanours and petty offences.

### Article 3: Principle of Legality

Conduct may give rise to criminal conviction only if it constituted an offence at the time it occurred.

A penalty may be imposed only if it was legally applicable at the time the offence was committed.

### Article 4: Intent

There shall be no offence in the absence of intent to commit it.

However, where so provided by law, an offence may result from recklessness, carelessness, negligence or failure to fulfil a specific obligation.

### Article 5: Interpretation of Criminal Law

In criminal matters, the law shall be strictly construed. A judge may neither extend its scope of application nor interpret it by analogy.

### Article 6: Pronouncement of Penalty

No penalty may be enforced unless it was pronounced by the court.

### Article 7: Application of Cambodian Criminal Law

In criminal matters, the scope of application of Cambodian law in space shall be determined by the provisions of this Code, subject to international treaties.

### Article 8: No Impunity for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law

The provisions of this Code may not have the effect of denying justice to the victims of serious offences which, under special legislation, are characterised as violations of international humanitarian law, international custom, or international conventions recognised by the Kingdom of Cambodia.
