# Additional Information about the Cambodian Criminal Code

The Cambodian Penal Code, also known as the 2009 Criminal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia or Cambodia's Criminal Law Statute, is the primary legislation defining crimes, penalties, and criminal responsibility in the country. This legal framework, sometimes referred to as the Khmer Criminal Legislation or the Penal Code of Cambodia (2009), was promulgated on November 30, 2009, and entered into force on December 10, 2010. It was signed by King Norodom Sihamoni, based on a request from Prime Minister Hun Sen and Justice Minister Ang Vong Vathana. The code consists of 6 books, encompassing 672 articles, and aims to ensure justice, protect human rights, and maintain social order.

Fundamental principles protect national institutions and public order.

- **Book 5: Transitional Provisions**: Provides rules for applying the code to prior offences, statute of limitations, and extension of general provisions. It ensures smooth transition from old laws.

### Core Concepts and Ideas

The Penal Statute of Cambodia 2009 emphasizes the principle of legality (no crime or punishment without law), individual criminal responsibility, protections for victims (especially minors and vulnerable groups), and graduated penalties based on severity (felonies, misdemeanours, petty offences). Key ideas include intent as a requirement for most offences, territorial and extraterritorial jurisdiction, aggravating factors (e.g., organised crime, use of weapons), mitigating circumstances, and liability for legal entities. It incorporates international humanitarian law, prohibiting impunity for serious violations, and promotes fair justice through rules on attempts, accomplices, and multiple convictions.
