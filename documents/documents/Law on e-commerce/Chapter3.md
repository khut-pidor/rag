## Chapter 3: Electronic Communications Process

### Article 15: Time and place of dispatch and receipt of information in electronic communications

1. Information in an electronic communication is deemed dispatched when:  
   a. The information leaves the information system that is under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator; or  
   b. In case that the information is sent but it has not left the information system that is under the control of the originator or of the party who sent it on behalf of the originator, the information is deemed that it is dispatched when such information is received at any time.
2. Information in an electronic communication is deemed to be dispatched from the place of business of the originator, no matter where it is dispatched.
3. The time of receipt of an information is the time when the information becomes capable of being retrieved by the addressee at the electronic address designated by the addressee. The information is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business.
4. If a specific electronic address has not been provided by the addressee, the time of receipt of an information is the time when the addressee becomes aware of the dispatch and retrievability at any electronic address and the information is deemed to be received at the place of business of the recipient.
5. If the electronic address is provided by the addressee, the information in the electronic communication is deemed to be received when it reaches the electronic address of the addressee, and is deemed to be received at the place where the addressee has its place of business.

### Article 16: Offer for forming a contract

Any proposal to enter into a contract through an electronic communication which is not addressed to any other specific person is considered as an invitation to make an offer for forming a contract only. The proposal will be considered as an offer for creating a contract if the proposal clearly indicates the intention of the party that it shall be bound when there is an acceptance from the other party.

### Article 17: Use of automated system for contract formation

A contract formed by the interaction of an automated system of a person with any natural person, or with the automated systems of another person, shall not be denied validity, legal effect, or enforceability of the contract on the ground that no natural person directly reviewed or intervened in the automated system or in forming the contract.

### Article 18: Error of information input in electronic communication

Where a natural person makes an information input error in an electronic communication with the automated system of another party, and the automated system does not provide the person with an opportunity to correct the input error, that person, or the party on whose behalf that person was acting, has the right to make correction or withdraw the input error in case:

1. The person notifies the other party of the error as soon as possible after having learned of the error, and indicates that he had made an error in the electronic communication; and
2. The person has not benefitted in any way from the error, prior to notification to the other party, and has not caused any damages of interest to the other party or any third party.

The provision as stated in this Article shall not be applicable to the securities sector.
