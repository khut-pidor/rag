### Article 43: New Partner's Liability

A person admitted as a general partner into an existing general partnership shall be liable for all liabilities the general partnership incurred before his admission as if he had been a partner when such liabilities were incurred.

A general partner who has not been declared is called a silent partner and is liable to third parties for the same obligations as declared general partners.
