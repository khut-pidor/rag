#### D. When a Person Ceases to Be a General Partner

### Article 48: When a Person Ceases to be a Partner

A person ceases to be a general partner of a general partnership when the person:

- transfers his interest,

- dies,

- is placed under protective supervision bankrupt

- exercises his right to withdraw,

- is expelled from the general partnership,

- a judgment authorizes his withdrawal or orders the seizure of his interest.

### Article 49: Effect on Partnership

Unless the general partnership contract provides otherwise, the fact that a person ceases to be a general partner does not automatically cause the dissolution of the general partnership.

The general partnership may continue by unanimous consent of all of general partners and by complying with filing and registration requirements to reflect the changes in the general partnership.

Where there is a written contract of general partnership, the contract shall be amended in accordance with the changes.

### Article 50: Right of a Person Who Ceases to be a Partner

A person who ceases to be a general partner of the general partnership, otherwise than by the transfer or seizure of his interest, may obtain the value of his interest upon ceasing to be a general partner. The other general partners are bound to pay the person the amount of the value as soon as it is established, with interest from the day on which he ceases to be a general partner.

The value of the interest is determined as provided in the general partnership contract or an agreement among the general partners. Otherwise, the value is determined by an expert designated by the general partners or by the court.

### Article 51: Right of Withdrawal

A general partner of a general partnership constituted for a term that is not fixed or whose contract of general partnership reserves the right of withdrawal may withdraw from the general partnership by giving the general partners notice of his withdrawal, in good faith.

Unless the general partnership contract provides otherwise, a general partner of a general partnership constituted for a term that is fixed may withdraw only with the agreement of a majority of the other general partners.

### Article 52: Expulsion of a Partner

The general partners may, by a majority vote, agree on the expulsion of a general partner who fails to perform his obligations or hinders the carrying on of the activities of the general partner.

In the case of any objection, a general partner may, in these circumstances, apply to the court for authorization to withdraw from the general partnership. The court shall grant the demand if it considers it more appropriate to order the expulsion of the general partner at fault.
